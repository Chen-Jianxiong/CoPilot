The PageRank algorithm measures the influence of each vertex on every other vertex. PageRank influence is defined recursively: a vertex’s influence is based on the influence of the vertices which refer to it. A vertex’s influence tends to increase if either of these conditions are met:
* It has more referring vertices
* Its referring vertices have higher influence

To run this algorithm, use `runInstalledQuery('tg_pagerank', params={'v_type': 'INSERT_V_TYPE_HERE', 'e_type': 'INSERT_E_TYPE_HERE', 'top_k': INSERT_TOP_K_HERE})`, where the parameters are:
* 'v_type': The vertex type to run the algorithm on.
* 'e_type': The edge type to run the algorithm on.
* 'top_k': The number of top scoring vertices to return to the user.
