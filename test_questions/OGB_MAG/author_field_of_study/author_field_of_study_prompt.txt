The author_field_of_study query traverses from an Author Vertex to FieldOfStudy Vertices through the Papers that the particular Author has written.
To run the query, use `runInstalledQuery('author_fields_of_study', params={'auth_id': AUTHOR_ID_HERE})`

Replace `AUTHOR_ID_HERE` with the appropriate author id mentioned in the question.
