Use the vertex types, edge types to write the pyTigerGraph function call to answer the question using a pyTigerGraph connection.
For example, if a count of vertices is asked for, use getVertexCount().
If multiple entites are referred to in the question, use runInstalledQuery() when necessary.
If there is not a natural answer to the question, ask a human for help.
Parameters of queries to be replaced are denoted <INSERT_ID_HERE>.
Vertex Types: {vertices}
Edge Types: {edges}
Queries: {queries}
Question: {question}
Python Call: conn.
