`getEdges(sourceVertexType: str, sourceVertexId: str, edgeType: str = "", targetVertexType: str = "", targetVertexId: str = "", where: str = "", limit: Union[int, str] = None, sort: str = "", withId: bool = True, withType: bool = False, timeout: int = 0)` → Union[dict, str, pd.DataFrame]

Retrieves edges of the given edge type originating from a specific source vertex.

Only sourceVertexType and sourceVertexId are required. If targetVertexId is specified, then targetVertexType must also be specified. If targetVertexType is specified, then edgeType must also be specified.
Parameters:

    sourceVertexType: The name of the source vertex type.

    sourceVertexId: The primary ID value of the source vertex instance.

    edgeType: The name of the edge type.

    targetVertexType: The name of the target vertex type.

    targetVertexId: The primary ID value of the target vertex instance.

    where: Comma separated list of conditions that are all applied on each edge’s attributes. The conditions are in logical conjunction (i.e. they are "AND’ed" together).

    sort: Comma separated list of attributes the results should be sorted by.

    limit: Maximum number of edge instances to be returned (after sorting).

    withId: (When the output format is "df") Should the source and target vertex types and IDs be included in the dataframe?

    withType: (When the output format is "df") Should the edge type be included in the dataframe?

    timeout: Time allowed for successful execution (0 = no time limit, default).

Returns:

The (selected) details of the (matching) edge instances (sorted, limited) as dictionary, JSON or pandas DataFrame.
