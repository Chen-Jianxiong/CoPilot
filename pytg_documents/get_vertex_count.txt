`getVertexCount(vertexType: Union[str, list] = "*", where: str = "", realtime: bool = False)` → Union[int, dict]

Returns the number of vertices of the specified type.
Parameters:
    vertexType (Union[str, list], optional): The name of the vertex type. If vertexType == "*", then count the instances of all vertex types (where cannot be specified in this case). Defaults to "*".

    where (str, optional): A comma separated list of conditions that are all applied on each vertex’s attributes. The conditions are in logical conjunction (i.e. they are "AND’ed" together). Defaults to "".

    realtime (bool, optional): Whether to get the most up-to-date number by force. When there are frequent updates happening, a slightly outdated number (up to 30 seconds delay) might be fetched. Set realtime=True to force the system to recount the vertices, which will get a more up-to-date result but will also take more time. This parameter only works with TigerGraph DB 3.6 and above. Defaults to False.

Returns:
    A dictionary of <vertex_type>: <vertex_count> pairs if vertexType is a list or "*".

    An integer of vertex count if vertexType is a single vertex type.

Uses:
    If vertexType is specified only: count of the instances of the given vertex type(s).

    If vertexType and where are specified: count of the instances of the given vertex type after being filtered by where condition(s).
