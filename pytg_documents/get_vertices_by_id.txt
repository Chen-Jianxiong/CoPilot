`getVerticesById(vertexType: str, vertexIds: Union[int, str, list], select: str = "", fmt: str = "py", withId: bool = True, withType: bool = False, timeout: int = 0)` â†’ Union[list, str, pd.DataFrame]

Retrieves vertices of the given vertex type, identified by their ID.
Parameters:
    vertexType: The name of the vertex type.

    vertexIds: A single vertex ID or a list of vertex IDs.

    select: Comma separated list of vertex attributes to be retrieved.

    fmt: Format of the results:
    "py": Python objects (in a list) "json": JSON document "df": pandas DataFrame

    withId: (If the output format is "df") should the vertex ID be included in the dataframe?

    withType: (If the output format is "df") should the vertex type be included in the dataframe?

    timeout: Time allowed for successful execution (0 = no limit, default).

Returns:
    The (selected) details of the (matching) vertex instances as dictionary, JSON or pandas DataFrame.
