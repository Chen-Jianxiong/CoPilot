`getEdgeCount(edgeType: str = "*", sourceVertexType: str = "", targetVertexType: str = "")` â†’ dict

Returns the number of edges of an edge type.

This is a simplified version of getEdgeCountFrom(), to be used when the total number of edges of a given type is needed, regardless which vertex instance they are originated from. See documentation of getEdgeCountFrom above for more details.
Parameters:

    edgeType: The name of the edge type.

    sourceVertexType: The name of the source vertex type.

    targetVertexType: The name of the target vertex type.

Returns:

A dictionary of edge_type: edge_count pairs.
